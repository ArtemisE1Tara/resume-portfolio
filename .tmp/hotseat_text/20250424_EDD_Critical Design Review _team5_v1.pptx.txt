Build and Assembly Record


Build and Assembly Record


Form
● SYSTEM HOUSING should be 
printed with PETG ﬁlament
● SYSTEM should not exceed 200 
grams
● SYSTEM should be contained in a 
3d printed HOUSING 97mm±3mm 
x 67mm±3mm x 59mm±3mm 
(Length x Width x Height)


Fit
● SYSTEM should be mounted 
semi-permanently to the wall via 
self tapping screws. 
● SYSTEM should remain 
mounted for at least 3 years.


Function
● SYSTEM should detect an OCCUPANT in a chair from 15 ft 
away
● SYSTEM should detect chair data upon USER request with a 
maximum latency of 1 second. 
● SYSTEM should be able to detect 2 OCCUPANTS  with an 
accuracy of ± 1
● SYSTEM should be powered via wired 5.1V 5A power.
