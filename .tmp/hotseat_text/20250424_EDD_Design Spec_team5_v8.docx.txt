Chapter  1:  Scope  
1.1:  Problem  Statement  
In  today’s  modern  society,  public  establishments  are  flourishing  with  an  abundance  of  
people
 
using
 
their
 
resources.
 
A
 
commonality
 
is
 
that
 
many
 
of
 
these
 
places
 
run
 
out
 
of
 
seats
 
to
 
host
 
all
 
users.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
problem
 
we
 
face.
 
In
 
2023,
 
an
 
average
 
of
 
1,649
 
people
 
visited
 
the
 
Carmel
 
Library
 
each
 
day
 
(CCPL
 
Annual
 
Report,
 
2023).
 
In
 
further
 
research,
 
we
 
conducted
 
a
 
poll
 
by
 
posting
 
surveys
 
around
 
the
 
school
 
questioning
 
students
 
about
 
their
 
experience
 
at
 
the
 
public
 
library.
 
After
 
59
 
responses,
 
66%
 
of
 
people
 
said
 
that
 
the
 
library
 
is
 
always
 
at
 
least
 
somewhat
 
busy,
 
with
 
73%
 
saying
 
it's
 
difficult
 
to
 
find
 
adequate
 
seating.
 
Afterwards,
 
we
 
interviewed
 
two
 
Carmel
 
Clay
 
Public
 
Library
 
Workers.
 
Many
 
mentioned
 
the
 
same
 
issues:“Especially
 
in
 
the
 
mornings
 
and
 
between
 
4-6
 
pm
 
afterschool,
 
every
 
seat
 
is
 
filled
 
with
 
students.
 
I
 
see
 
many
 
people
 
walking
 
around
 
looking
 
for
 
study
 
space”
 
(CCPL
  
Adult
 
Services
 
Employee).
 
In
 
essence,
 
the
 
occupancy
 
of
 
the
 
public
 
library
 
often
 
poses
 
a
 
common
 
problem
 
for
 
students
 
looking
 
for
 
study
 
space,
 
causing
 
many
 
people
 
to
 
walk
 
circles
 
around
 
the
 
building
 
in
 
search
 
of
 
an
 
empty
 
seat.
 
 
 
1.2:  Design  Statement  
A  SYSTEM  that  collects  occupancy  data  and  displays  the  information  to  the  user  in  an  
accessible
 
manner.
 
The
 
SYSTEM
 
should
 
help
 
individuals
 
determine
 
the
 
best
 
time
 
to
 
go
 
to
 
the
 
library
 
when
 
chairs
 
and/or
 
tables
 
are
 
occupied.
 
The
 
SYSTEM
 
should
 
be
 
discrete
 
and
 
should
 
not
 
interfere
 
with
 
library
 
patrons’
 
experience.

1.3:  Application  
The  design  specification  should  be  applied  as  a  standard  for  all  other  documents  to  
reference.
 
All
 
dimensional,
 
performance,
 
and
 
construction
 
constraints
 
should
 
be
 
listed
 
in
 
the
 
specification.
 
The
 
specification
 
should
 
be
 
applied
 
in
 
documents
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
test
 
instruction,
 
build
 
and
 
assembly
 
instruction,
 
and
 
in
 
deliverables
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
critical
 
design
 
review,
 
by
 
providing
 
performance
 
guidelines,
 
dimension
 
constraints,
 
and
 
a
 
record
 
of
 
progress.
 
The
 
SYSTEM
 
should
 
be
 
designed
 
to
 
assist
 
patrons
 
with
 
locating
 
open
 
seating
 
in
 
a
 
public
 
space.
 
Due
 
to
 
this
 
criteria,
 
the
 
SYSTEM
 
should
 
be
 
applied
 
in
 
a
 
library
 
setting.
 
Its
 
crowd
 
control
 
and
 
open
 
seating
 
regulation
 
capabilities
 
lend
 
themselves
 
to
 
use
 
in
 
an
 
indoor,
 
public
 
setting
 
with
 
non
 
assigned
 
seating,
 
such
 
as
 
a
 
library.
 
 
1.4:  Limitation  
 The  SYSTEM  will  be  limited  by  the  budget  of  the  project,  the  schedule  and  limited  time  
of
 
the
 
project,
 
and
 
the
 
method
 
with
 
which
 
it
 
collects
 
and
 
processes
 
data.
 
The
 
budget
 
for
 
the
 
project
 
is
 
300
 
dollars
 
total,
 
with
 
a
 
limitation
 
of
 
150
 
dollars
 
allocated
 
for
 
each
 
semester.
 
The
 
project
 
was
 
limited
 
to
 
a
 
time
 
frame
 
of
 
the
 
standard
 
academic
 
year
 
of
 
36
 
weeks,
 
with
 
18
 
weeks
 
per
 
semester.
 
The
 
Raspberry
 
Pi
 
camera
 
should
 
be
 
limited
 
by
 
its
 
range
 
and
 
focal
 
length.
 
Onboard
 
local
 
processing
 
may
 
produce
 
excess
 
heat.
