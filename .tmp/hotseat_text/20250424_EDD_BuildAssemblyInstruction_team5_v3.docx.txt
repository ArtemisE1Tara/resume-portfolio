Chapter  1:  Scope  
1.1:  Application  
The  design  specification  should  be  applied  as  a  standard  for  all  other  documents  to  
reference.
 
All
 
dimensional,
 
performance,
 
and
 
construction
 
constraints
 
should
 
be
 
listed
 
in
 
the
 
specification.
 
The
 
specification
 
should
 
be
 
applied
 
in
 
documents
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
test
 
instruction,
 
build
 
and
 
assembly
 
instruction,
 
and
 
in
 
deliverables
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
critical
 
design
 
review,
 
by
 
providing
 
performance
 
guidelines,
 
dimension
 
constraints,
 
and
 
a
 
record
 
of
 
progress.
 
The
 
SYSTEM
 
should
 
be
 
designed
 
to
 
assist
 
patrons
 
with
 
locating
 
open
 
seating
 
in
 
a
 
public
 
space.
 
Due
 
to
 
this
 
criteria,
 
the
 
SYSTEM
 
should
 
be
 
applied
 
in
 
a
 
library
 
setting.
 
Its
 
crowd
 
control
 
and
 
open
 
seating
 
regulation
 
capabilities
 
lend
 
themselves
 
to
 
use
 
in
 
an
 
indoor,
 
public
 
setting
 
with
 
non
 
assigned
 
seating,
 
such
 
as
 
a
 
library.
 
 
1.2:  Limitation  
 The  SYSTEM  will  be  limited  by  the  budget  of  the  project,  the  schedule  and  limited  time  
of
 
the
 
project,
 
and
 
the
 
method
 
with
 
which
 
it
 
collects
 
and
 
processes
 
data.
 
The
 
budget
 
for
 
the
 
project
 
is
 
300
 
dollars
 
total,
 
with
 
a
 
limitation
 
of
 
150
 
dollars
 
allocated
 
for
 
each
 
semester.
 
The
 
project
 
was
 
limited
 
to
 
a
 
time
 
frame
 
of
 
the
 
standard
 
academic
 
year
 
of
 
36
 
weeks,
 
with
 
18
 
weeks
 
per
 
semester.
 
The
 
Raspberry
 
Pi
 
camera
 
should
 
be
 
limited
 
by
 
its
 
range
 
and
 
focal
 
length.
 
Onboard
 
local
 
processing
 
may
 
produce
 
excess
 
heat.

Chapter  3:  Safety  Precautions  
 3.1  Danger  
3.1.1  Electrocution  –  Do  not  touch  the  raspberry  pi  while  it  is  in  operation,  the  current  
will
 
cause
 
electrocution
 
which
 
will
 
result
 
in
 
serious
 
injury
 
or
 
death.
 
 
3.2  Warning  
3.2.1  Possible  electrocution  -  Touching  the  device  or  tampering/opening  the   device  while  
it
 
is
 
in
 
operation
 
could
 
result
 
in
 
electrocution,
 
which
 
will
 
result
 
in
 
serious
 
injury
 
or
 
death.
 
 
3.2.2  Small  parts  -  During  assembly,  account  for  all  magnets  and  keep  away  from  
children.
 
Swallowing
 
magnets
 
could
 
result
 
in
 
serious
 
injury
 
or
 
death.
 
 
3.3  Caution  
3.3.1  Pinching  hazard  -  While  closing  the  lid  on  the  system,  keep  fingers  outside  the  box  
to
 
avoid
 
pinching,
 
which
 
could
 
cause
 
minor
 
injury.
 
 
3.3.2  Sharp  edges  -  The  system  is  3D  printed,  so  the  edges  of  the  device  may  have  sharp  
fragments
 
that
 
can
 
cause
 
minor
 
injury.
 
 
3.4  Notice  
3.4.1  This  device  is  not  suitable  for  anyone  under  the  age  of  eighteen.  
3.4.2  A  drill  should  not  be  used  for  installation  of  the  tapping  screws,  as  it  could  cause  
the
 
casing
 
to
 
break.
 
 
3.4.3  Water  should  not  come  in  contact  with  any  electrical  component  of  the  device  as  it  
could
 
subject
 
it
 
to
 
breakage.

Chapter  4:  Supporting  and  Test  Equipment/Tools/Fixtures  
4.1:  Supporting  Equipment   
4.1.1  Screwdriver  -  A  screwdriver  must  be  used  to  insert  the  tapping  screws  that  will  
attach
 
the
 
Raspberry
 
Pi
 
to
 
the
 
casing.
 
4.2:  Test  Equipment  
4.2.1  Ruler  -  A  ruler  must  be  used  to  take  dimensions  of  the  3D  printed  model  and  
confirm
 
the
 
tolerances
 
were
 
followed.
 
 4.2.2  Computer  -  A  computer  must  be  used  to  run  all  of  the  software  diagnostics.  
4.2.3  Scale  -  A  scale  must  be  used  to  weigh  the  assembly  and  confirm  the  3D  printed  
model
 
is
 
correct.
