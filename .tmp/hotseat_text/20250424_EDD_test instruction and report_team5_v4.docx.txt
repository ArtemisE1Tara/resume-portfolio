Chapter  1:  Scope  
1.1:  Application  
The  design  specification  should  be  applied  as  a  standard  for  all  other  documents  to  
reference.
 
All
 
dimensional,
 
performance,
 
and
 
construction
 
constraints
 
should
 
be
 
listed
 
in
 
the
 
specification.
 
The
 
specification
 
should
 
be
 
applied
 
in
 
documents
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
test
 
instruction,
 
build
 
and
 
assembly
 
instruction,
 
and
 
in
 
deliverables
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
critical
 
design
 
review,
 
by
 
providing
 
performance
 
guidelines,
 
dimension
 
constraints,
 
and
 
a
 
record
 
of
 
progress.
 
The
 
system
 
should
 
be
 
designed
 
to
 
assist
 
patrons
 
with
 
locating
 
open
 
seating
 
in
 
a
 
public
 
space.
 
Due
 
to
 
this
 
criteria,
 
the
 
system
 
should
 
be
 
applied
 
in
 
a
 
library
 
setting.
 
Its
 
crowd
 
control
 
and
 
open
 
seating
 
regulation
 
capabilities
 
lend
 
themselves
 
to
 
use
 
in
 
an
 
indoor,
 
public
 
setting
 
with
 
non
 
assigned
 
seating,
 
such
 
as
 
a
 
library.
 
 
1.2:  Limitation  
The  system  will  be  limited  by  the  budget  of  the  project,  the  schedule  and  limited  time  of  
the
 
project,
 
and
 
the
 
method
 
with
 
which
 
it
 
collects
 
and
 
processes
 
data.
 
The
 
budget
 
for
 
the
 
project
 
is
 
300
 
dollars
 
total,
 
with
 
a
 
limitation
 
of
 
150
 
dollars
 
allocated
 
for
 
each
 
semester.
 
The
 
project
 
was
 
limited
 
to
 
a
 
time
 
frame
 
of
 
the
 
standard
 
academic
 
year
 
of
 
36
 
weeks,
 
with
 
18
 
weeks
 
per
 
semester.
 
The
 
Raspberry
 
Pi
 
camera
 
should
 
be
 
limited
 
by
 
its
 
range
 
and
 
focal
 
length.
 
Onboard
 
local
 
processing
 
may
 
produce
 
excess
 
heat.

Chapter  3:  Safety  Precautions  
 3.1  Danger  
3.1.1  Electrocution  –  Do  not  touch  the  raspberry  pi  while  it  is  in  operation,  the  current  
will
 
cause
 
electrocution
 
which
 
will
 
result
 
in
 
serious
 
injury
 
or
 
death.
 
 
3.2  Warning  
3.2.1  Possible  electrocution  -  Touching  the  device  or  tampering/opening  the   device  while  
it
 
is
 
in
 
operation
 
could
 
result
 
in
 
electrocution,
 
which
 
will
 
result
 
in
 
serious
 
injury
 
or
 
death.
 
 
3.2.2  Small  parts  -  During  assembly,  account  for  all  magnets  and  keep  away  from  
children.
 
Swallowing
 
magnets
 
could
 
result
 
in
 
serious
 
injury
 
or
 
death.
 
 
3.3  Caution  
3.3.1  Pinching  hazard  -  While  closing  the  lid  on  the  system,  keep  fingers  outside  the  box  
to
 
avoid
 
pinching,
 
which
 
could
 
cause
 
minor
 
injury.
 
 
3.3.2  Sharp  edges  -  The  system  is  3D  printed,  so  the  edges  of  the  device  may  have  sharp  
fragments
 
that
 
can
 
cause
 
minor
 
injury.
 
 
3.4  Notice  
3.4.1  This  device  is  not  suitable  for  anyone  under  the  age  of  eighteen.  
3.4.2  A  drill  should  not  be  used  for  installation  of  the  tapping  screws,  as  it  could  cause  
the
 
casing
 
to
 
break.
 
 
3.4.3  Water  should  not  come  in  contact  with  any  electrical  component  of  the  device  as  it  
could
 
subject
 
it
 
to
 
breakage.

Chapter  7:  Testing  Procedures  
 Feature  Procedures  
3.1.1  Inspect  the  label  on  the  bottom  surface  of  the  system  and  verify  that  it  reads  PETG  filament.   
3.1.2  Obtain  a  scale,  setting  the  units  to  grams,  and  weigh  the  system.  Verify  that  the  reading  is  within  5g  of  200g.   
3.1.3  Obtain  a  ruler  with  millimeter  units,  and  verify  that  the  length  of  the  system  is  97mm,  the  width  is  67mm,  and  the  height  is  59mm.  Note  that  if  these  dimensions  are  within  3mm  of  the  target  values  it  is  still  considered  a  pass  due  to  tolerance.   
3.2.1  Obtain  a  tape  measure  using  Imperial  units  and  position  a  test  occupant  15  ft  away  from  the  system  and  run  a  trail  analysis.  
3.2.2  Run  a  test  detection  with  a  single  occupant,  use  the  inbuilt  software  delay  timer  to  ensure  that  the  delay  is  less  than  1  second.  
3.2.3  Run  a  test  detection  using  two  separate  occupants  in  separate  seating  arrangements.   
3.2.4  Connect  the  system  to  a  power  supply  producing   5.1V  and  5A  and  ensure  that  all  processes  function  properly  by  testing  procedures  3.2.1-3.2.3  
3.3.1  Use  a  screwdriver  or  electric  drill  to  secure  the  system  to  the  wall  using  included  self  tapping  screws  of  the  proper  size.  Apply  tension  to  the  attachment  and  ensure  that  the  fastening  will  not  release  
3.3.2  Apply  constant,  strong,  tension  to  the  attachment  point  to  simulate  at  least  3  years  of  regular  wear  (supporting  the  weight  of  the  system).  
4.1.1  Using  a  thermostat  and  a  humidity  monitor,  

OKAA  Solutions   15  
ensure  that  the  system  is  functioning  at  multiple  points  along  the  suggested  temperature  range.  
4.1.2  The  system  is  statically  installed  and  will  not  be  exposed  to  vibrations  or  high  stress  conditions.  
4.1.3  Apply  constant,  strong,  tension  to  the  attachment  point  to  simulate  at  least  3  years  of  regular  wear  (supporting  the  weight  of  the  system).  
4.2.1  Run  continuous  detections  at  a  higher  rate  than  typical  to  simulate  one  week  of  use,  ensure  that  only  one  failure  occurred.  
4.3.1  This  has  been  verified  by  the  manufacturer  and  therefore  does  not  require  a  testing  procedure.   
4.3.2  This  has  been  verified  by  the  manufacturer  and  therefore  does  not  require  a  testing  procedure.   
4.4.1  Ensure  that  the  system  lag  time  does  not  increase  drastically  over  the  lifespan  of  the  system  to  verify  that  it  is  receiving  updates.  
4.4.2  This  has  been  verified  by  the  manufacturer  and  therefore  does  not  require  a  testing  procedure.   
4.4.3  This  has  been  verified  by  the  manufacturer  and  therefore  does  not  require  a  testing  procedure.   
4.4.4  This  has  been  verified  by  the  manufacturer  and  therefore  does  not  require  a  testing  procedure.   
4.4.5  This  has  been  verified  by  the  manufacturer  and  therefore  does  not  require  a  testing  procedure.   
4.5.1  Should  an  error  occur,  cross-reference  the  error  message  with  NextJS  and  Python  debugging  tools  using  the  internet  or  an  IDE  

OKAA  Solutions   16  
and  compiler.   
4.6.1  Navigate  through  the  user  interface  before  and  after  setup  and  determine  if  the  user  components  match  their  functions  with  no  unnecessary  features.   
4.6.2  After  mounting  the  system,  ensure  that  it  remains  in  place  without  any  human  assistance.   
4.7.1  Verify  using  the  label  that  the  system  was  3D  printed  at  a  local  location.   
4.7.2  Inspect  the  wiring  and  mounting  components  and  visually  verify  that  they  match  those  on  the  parts  list  and  do  not  switch  them  out  or  remove  them.   
4.8.1  When  the  manufacturer  releases  a  system  update,  ensure  there  is  no  lag  time  in  the  processing  of  the  system  by  beginning  or  continuing  usage.
